Fumadocs is a docs framework, but it's also a powerful tool to manage content in Next.js. You can use Fumadocs to build a blog site along with docs, on a single Next.js app.

## Overview

This guide helps you build a blog site with Fumadocs and Fumadocs MDX.

We will use Fumadocs MDX to manage the content, and implement our own UI with Tailwind CSS & Fumadocs UI.

### Configure Content

Define a `blogPosts` collection.


Parse the output collection in `source.ts`:


You can now access the content from `blog`.

### Implement UI

Create an index page for blog posts.

By default, there should be a `(home)` route group with `<HomeLayout />` inside.
Let's put the blog pages under it, this way we can get the nice navbar on our blog site.

Colors like `text-fd-muted-foreground` are from the design system of Fumadocs UI, you may also use your own colors, or use Shadcn UI.

And create a page for blog posts.

Note that blog posts won't have nested slugs like `/slug1/slug2`. We don't need a catch-all route for blog posts.


And configure metadata:


### Write Posts

The UI is now complete, you can write some blog posts under the `content/blog` directory, like:

```mdx title="content/blog/hello.mdx"
---
title: Hello World

## Hello World

This is an example!
```

After spinning up the development server with `next dev`, you should see the blog posts under `/blog` route.
