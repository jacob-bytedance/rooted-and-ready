description: Use MDX file as a page

## Setup

You can use `page.mdx` instead of `page.tsx` for creating a new page under the app directory.

However, it doesn't have MDX components by default, so you have to provide them:



### Usage

```mdx title="app/test/page.mdx"
{/* this will enable Typography styles of Fumadocs UI */}
export { withArticle as default } from 'fumadocs-ui/page';

## Hello World
```
