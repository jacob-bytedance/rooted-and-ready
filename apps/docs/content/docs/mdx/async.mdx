title: Async Mode
description: Runtime compilation of content files.

## Introduction

By default, all Markdown and MDX files need to be pre-compiled first. The same constraint also applies to the development server.

This may result in longer dev server start times for large docs sites. You can enable Async Mode on `doc` collections to improve this.

### Setup

Install required dependencies.

```package-install
@fumadocs/mdx-remote shiki
```

Enable Async Mode.

```ts tab="Docs Collection"
import { defineDocs } from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';

export const docs = defineDocs({
  dir: 'content/docs',
  docs: {
    async: true,
  },
});
```

```ts tab="Doc Collection"
import { defineCollections } from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';

export const doc = defineCollections({
  type: 'doc',
  dir: 'content/docs',
  async: true,
});
```

### Usage

Async Mode allows on-demand compilation of Markdown and MDX content by moving the compilation process from build time to Next.js runtime.

However, you need to invoke the `load()` async function to load and compile content.

For example:



When using Async Mode, we highly recommend to use third-party services to implement search, which usually have better capability to handle massive amount of content to index.

### Constraints

It comes with some limitations on MDX features.

- No import/export allowed in MDX files. For MDX components, pass them from the `components` prop instead.
- Images must be referenced with URL (e.g. `/images/test.png`). Don't use **file paths** like `./image.png`. You should locate your images in the `public` folder and reference them with URLs.
