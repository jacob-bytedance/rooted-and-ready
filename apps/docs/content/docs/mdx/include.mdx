## Usage

### Markdown

Specify the target Markdown file path in the ````

This will display the content from the target file (e.g. `another.mdx`).

### CodeBlock

For other types of files, it will become a codeblock:

```mdx title="page.mdx"

```

### `cwd`

Resolve relative paths from cwd instead of the Markdown file:

```mdx
```
