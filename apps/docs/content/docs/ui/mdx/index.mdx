## Usage

The default MDX components include Cards, Callouts, Code Blocks and Headings.

```ts
import defaultMdxComponents from 'fumadocs-ui/mdx';
```

### Relative Link

To support links with relative file path in `href`, override the default `a` component with:


```mdx
[My Link](./file.mdx)
```

[Example: `../(integrations)/open-graph.mdx`](<../(integrations)/open-graph.mdx>)

<Callout type="warn">Server Component only.</Callout>
